        <p>The Octopus project deals with the development of a Code Intelligence System. The system continuously accumulates security relevant
information about program code used within an organization, makes it
accessible to both analysts and tools, and employs pattern recognition
techniques to recommend code that contains flaws with high
probability. Built with emerging "big data" components under the hood,
the resulting code analysis platform is designed to handle
distributions worth of code. This is a requirement for the approach as
statistical methods cannot function correctly without large amounts of
data at their disposal. We additionally make an effort to provide
clean interfaces to extend the platform, to enable research on new
methods for code analysis, and adaption to the unique requirements of
the programs under inspection.</p>
