        <p>The Octopus project deals with the development of a Code Intelligence System. The system continuously accumulates security relevant
information about program code used within an organization, makes it
accessible to both analysts and tools, and employs pattern recognition
techniques to recommend code that contains flaws with high
probability. Built with emerging "big data" components under the hood,
the resulting code analysis platform is designed to handle
distributions worth of code. This is a requirement for the approach as
statistical methods cannot function correctly without large amounts of
data at their disposal. We additionally make an effort to provide
clean interfaces to extend the platform, to enable research on new
methods for code analysis, and adaption to the unique requirements of
the programs under inspection.</p>

<p>To date, security systems focus mainly on the detection of known
vulnerabilities, attacks, and malicious code. With attackers in mind
who concentrate on compromising a large number of hosts with minimum
effort, and no particular target in mind, these strategies seem
reasonable.</p>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum, organizations may be targeted by
attackers willing to invest time and resources to compromise that
organization's network in particular, or even the devices of one
specific individual. While realistically speaking, an attacker
investing above a certain threshold will succeed, it is worth asking
whether we can find a middle ground between protecting against known
vulnerabilities only, and auditing for vulnerabilities day and night.</p>

<p>In essence, it must be hard to identify new vulnerabilities in the
programs we deploy because flaws that are obvious no longer exist. An
attacker should be unable to identify a previously unknown
vulnerability simply by finding a variation of a known flaw, or by
scanning for vulnerabilities very typical for the type of application
or the libraries it uses.</p>

<p>This is not trivial. Today, successful identification of even simple
vulnerabilities and assessing of exploitability are tasks that
increasingly require a deep understanding of program
specifics. Experienced vulnerability researchers therefore suggest to
review both the program-specific APIs for quirks, as well as the
security history for common programming patterns that caused
vulnerabilities (see, for example, Chris Rohlf's BlackHat training on
vulnerability discovery (<a href="https://github.com/struct/mms">https://github.com/struct/mms</a>) and Dowd et
al.'s "The Art of Software Security Assessment".)</p>

<p>It is therefore not uncommon today to see articles about vulnerability
discovery and exploitation that focus entirely on the
security-relevant internals of a specific program (see Ilja van
Sprundel's work on Windows device drivers, argp's work on Firefox, or
huku's work on Flash). Knowledge of this kind is acquired in an often
painful research process that uncovers information limited in value to
a particular program, but absolutely required to identify relevant
vulnerabilities in it. This information is publicly available to
attackers and defenders alike and provides a starting point for
analysis.</p>

<p>To date, there is no system to concentrate what we know about the
typical vulnerabilities associated with programs, their libraries, and
programming languages. Moreover, there are no mechanisms to preserve
and share this information for other analysts to avoid flaws in the
future. Finally, no way of automatically exploiting this information
programmatically exists, that is, to build tools for semi-automated
vulnerability assessment that leverage this information.</p>

<p>The long-term objective of the Octopus project is to develop a novel
type of security component: a code intelligence system. The
system keeps track of the program code developed or used by an
organization, along with its development history, and in particular,
security patches, as well as knowledge about vulnerable programming
patterns accumulated over the past. With this information at hand, it
repeatedly mines programs for code that seems worth auditing, along
with useful hints on the difficulties associated with the use of the
employed APIs. As such, it provides a central point for code analysts
to share their knowledge, and to extract it for use in their tools.</p>
