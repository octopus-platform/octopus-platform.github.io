  "body": "The Octopus project deals with the development of a Code Intelligence System. The system continuously accumulates security relevant\r\ninformation about program code used within an organization, makes it\r\naccessible to both analysts and tools, and employs pattern recognition\r\ntechniques to recommend code that contains flaws with high\r\nprobability. Built with emerging \"big data\" components under the hood,\r\nthe resulting code analysis platform is designed to handle\r\ndistributions worth of code. This is a requirement for the approach as\r\nstatistical methods cannot function correctly without large amounts of\r\ndata at their disposal. We additionally make an effort to provide\r\nclean interfaces to extend the platform, to enable research on new\r\nmethods for code analysis, and adaption to the unique requirements of\r\nthe programs under inspection.",
